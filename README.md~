# ai3202-Assignment3
A* Search implementation.  I had no clue how to make directories in Git, so I did this filename instead.


The command line inputs are simple: worldName.txt followed by heuristicNumber
The two given worlds are in this repository.  Heuristic 1 (just type in 1) is Manhattan distance. Heuristic 2 is Diagonal Shortcut, which encourages diagonal moves toward the goal.  Heuristic 3 is Mister Bones' Wild Ride, which puts a randomizer from 1 to 50 instead of a heuristic.


Heuristic 2:

The world maps that were given to us often looked complicated near the edges, but more forgiving near the middle.  I wanted to see if a heuristic that encouraged staying to the middle of the map would improve my score at all.


H2(n) =
  if |y distance between goal and n| > |x distance between goal and n| :
    (14 * |distance x|) + (10 * |distance y| - |distance x|)
  OR
  if |y distance between goal and n| < |x distance between goal and n| :
    (14 * |distance y|) + (10 * |distance x| - |distance y|)


Somehow, Heuristic 2 managed to find two very similar paths between the two worlds, which both equated to 702 points.  Either way, Heuristic 2 recieved better scores from both worlds.
